                    I purchased the Eldar Harp and boy can I say it did not disappoint! My grandmother used to play the harp 
                    every Christmas Eve as we sang songs by the fire. Since then, it has been my childhood dream to play the 
                    harp! I new I was taking a gamble by purchasing my harp as a top quality instrument, but as I continue to 
                    learn, I realize just how perfect this harp is! I love it more each time I practice! It has since been 4 
                    years, and I have now joined the state orchestra as the sole harpist all thanks to this amazing Eldar Harp!

                    My brother gifted me the Quendi Guitar for my 20th birthday which is a major upgrade from my hand-me-down 
                    guitar I have been using my entire life. The quality and tone of this new guitar is so spectacular my 
                    professor couldn't even believe how perfect it is. I am a music major and this guitar is my new prized 
                    procession that I can use to show of my talent. There is a natural comfort and transition from using my 
                    previous guitar to the Quendi Guitar. For anyone wondering if there is any catch, there isn't! It is 
                    absolutely as perfect as described!

                    I just bought the Valar Violin and here are my thoughts: it is as pretty as the pictures show, it feels 
                    top quality, it has the smell of a freshly cut tree, it plays naturally and beautifully, and I have no 
                    complaints. 6 month update: I really have nothing bad to say about this instrument, with the exception of 
                    maybe the loss of the fresh tree smell, but that is going to happen over time. In terms of performance, I 
                    could not give any higher praise! The Elven quality is evident and it still feels brand new every time I 
                    play it!
