      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>When we first began crafting orchestral instruments, we found a common issue among customers: 
        instruments were long-lasting or hand-made, but not both.

        For the past 5 ½ years We've been mastering just that. By combining ancient Elven techniques 
        and spruce and maple trees, string instruments have evolved. We also used dwarf hairs as the 
        strings for our pieces.
        
        With these durable, personal, and elegant pieces, our customers receive the highest quality 
        instruments coupled with unbeatable pricing.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        I purchased the Eldar Harp and boy can I say it did not disappoint! My grandmother used to play the harp 
        every Christmas Eve as we sang songs by the fire. Since then, it has been my childhood dream to play the 
        harp! I new I was taking a gamble by purchasing my harp as a top quality instrument, but as I continue to 
        learn, I realize just how perfect this harp is! I love it more each time I practice! It has since been 4 
        years, and I have now joined the state orchestra as the sole harpist all thanks to this amazing Eldar Harp!

        My brother gifted me the Quendi Guitar for my 20th birthday which is a major upgrade from my hand-me-down 
        guitar I have been using my entire life. The quality and tone of this new guitar is so spectacular my 
        professor couldn't even believe how perfect it is. I am a music major and this guitar is my new prized 
        procession that I can use to show of my talent. There is a natural comfort and transition from using my 
        previous guitar to the Quendi Guitar. For anyone wondering if there is any catch, there isn't! It is 
        absolutely as perfect as described!

        I just bought the Valar Violin and here are my thoughts: it is as pretty as the pictures show, it feels 
        top quality, it has the smell of a freshly cut tree, it plays naturally and beautifully, and I have no 
        complaints. 6 month update: I really have nothing bad to say about this instrument, with the exception of 
        maybe the loss of the fresh tree smell, but that is going to happen over time. In terms of performance, I 
        could not give any higher praise! The elven quality is evident and it still feels brand new every time I 
        play it!

        This beautiful Quendi Guitar is handcrafted using cedarwood to achieve 
        its perfect resonating pitch and clean appearance. The textures and flourish added to increase the aesthetics 
        of the guitar come from Rivendell carpentry techniques. With meticulous hand crafted perfection, this beauty 
        is designed to create the longest lasting, best sounding guitar you will ever play. </p>
        <p>Our Valar Violin is of the utmost peak quality. Through careful research, our team has developed the perfect 
        maple wood violin, made with performance and professional production in mind. There is a reason why it is our best 
        selling string instrument. The purity, durability, and quality are the most delivering customer satisfaction 
        attributes this piece of art can offer. </p>
        <p>The Eldar Harp is our most ambitious yet most rewarding project we are proud to deliver. With many years of 
        patience and trial and error practice, the Eldar Harp is lightweight for a harp of its size and each one uses
        grown sycamore trees as a main wood source, and is constructed in our elven carpentry shop! We couldn't be 
        prouder to present a more special capstone instrument. Many folks tend to sleep on the elegance of the harp 
        class, but we know just how remarkable this harp will be in your hands!
