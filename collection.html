                its perfect resonating pitch and clean appearance. The textures and flourish added to increase the aesthetics 
                of the guitar come from Rivendell carpentry techniques. With meticulous hand crafted perfection, this beauty 
                is designed to create the longest lasting, best sounding guitar you will ever play. </p>

                The Eldar Harp is our most ambitious yet most rewarding project we are proud to deliver. With many years of 
                patience and trial and error practice, the Eldar Harp is lightweight for a harp of its size and each one uses
                grown sycamore trees as a main wood source, and is constructed in our elven carpentry shop! We couldn't be 
                prouder to present a more special capstone instrument. Many folks tend to sleep on the elegance of the harp 
                class, but we know just how remarkable this harp will be in your hands!</p>
